      <description>Course Goals#Analyze NLP techniques and apply them to text data. The course is divided into three main categories: s
Preprocessing: Demonstrate how to clean and integrate text data
Processing: Apply NLP algorithms on your pre-processed data to perform different tasks
Post-processing: Evaluate your developed NLP models.
Solve problems with real datasets Apply practical know-how (useful for jobs, research) through significant hands-on programming assignments
Course Pre- and/or Co-Requisites#Review our &amp;ldquo;warnings&amp;rdquo; before taking this course.</description>

      <description>Diversity &amp;amp; Inclusion#Just as machine learning algorithms cannot accomplish complex tasks if trained on datasets of limited variability, our course cannot be successful without appreciating the diversity of our students. In this class we aim to create an environment where all voices are valued, respecting the diversity of gender, sexuality, age, socioeconomic status, ability, ethnicity, race, and culture. We always welcome suggestions that can help us achieve this goal.</description>
